# Disease-Prediction-and-Medication-Recommendation-System

Project Overview: Developed a Python-based machine learning model to predict potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms and recommend medication . Implemented and compared
 four algorithms: SVM,RF, DT and Naive Bayes, selecting the most accurate model for deployment. Created a user-friendly graphical user interface
 (GUI) using Tkinter, allowing users to input symptoms, receive disease predictions, learn about necessary precautions, and obtain recommendations
 for appropriate salts based on diagnosed conditions.

Technologies Used: List the technologies, including Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

Machine Learning Models: Explain the models used (Decision Tree, SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and their roles in the prediction process.

Model Evaluation: Describe the evaluation metrics used to compare model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Installation Instructions: Provide steps to set up the project environment, including dependencies.

Usage: Explain how to run the application and input data for predictions.

Conclusion: Summarize the findings and potential future improvements.

This structure will help users understand the project and how to use it effectively. Project Overview

The application features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to input symptoms and receive predictions.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

GUI Framework: Tkinter

Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning Models

Decision Tree (DT): A tree-based model that splits the data into branches to make predictions based on feature values.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, suitable for classification tasks with categorical input features.

Random Forest (RF): An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.

Model Evaluation

Metrics Used:

Accuracy: The proportion of true results among the total number of cases examined.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
F1 Score: The weighted average of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.
